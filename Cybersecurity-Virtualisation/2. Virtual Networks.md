### 2.2.1. Capture your own DHCP traffic

1.  Are DHCP messages sent over UDP or TCP?
2.  What is the IP address of your DHCP server?
3.  Draw a timing datagram illustrating the sequence of the first four-packet Discover/Offer/Request/ACK DHCP exchange between the client and server. For each packet, indicated the source and destination port numbers.
4.  A host uses DHCP to obtain an IP address, among other things. But a host's IP address is not confirmed until the end of the four-message exchange! If the IP address is not set until the end of the four-message exchange, then what values are used in the IP datagrams in the four-message exchange? For each of the four DHCP messages (Discover/Offer/Request/ACK DHCP), indicate the source and destination IP addresses that are carried in the encapsulating IP datagram.
5.  Explain the purpose of the lease time. How long is the lease time in your experiment?
