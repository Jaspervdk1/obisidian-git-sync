# 4.2.1. Experiment with snapshots

The goal of this step is to experiment with snapshots in VirtualBox.

1.  Shutdown the virtual machine (if needed) and take a snapshot of the Virtual Machine
2.  Start the Virtual Machine and create a text file with some content on the Desktop
3.  Try to answer the following questions:
    -   Where is the base VDI stored? What size (in MB) is it?
    -   Where is the delta file stored? What size (in MB) is it?
4.  Power off the VM and restore the snapshot. Power on the virtual machine.
    -   Is the textfile still present on the desktop? Why (not)?
    -   Does this change anything to the base VDI?
    -   Does this remove the delta file?
    -   If the textfile is missing: create a new textfile on the desktop.
5.  Power off the VM again and delete the snapshot. Power on the virtual machine.
    -   Is the textfile still present on the desktop? Why (not)?
    -   Do you still have the delta file? Why (not)?

# 4.2.3. Disarm the VM and experiment with anti malware testfile

# 4.2.4. Break the clone

#  4.2.5. Restore your setup
